# FlowerGarden-Kotlin

This is my first Kotlin project. 

Includes:
- Gson
- ListView
- Intent

Achievements:
- Working with xml
- Activities
- Life Cycle
- Logic of adapters
- Drawables
- Reading data from json in local storage

Inferences:
- RecycleViews should be used
- Data Classes should be used as Model
- Should work with Fragments instead of Acitivities
